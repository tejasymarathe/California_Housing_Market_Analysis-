# California Housing Data Analysis Project

## Problem Statement

This project involves analyzing the California housing dataset to extract meaningful insights and demonstrate data science skills using Python. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including income distribution, housing age distribution, relationships between variables, handling missing data, and geographical data visualization.

## Questions Solved

1. **Average Median Income and Data Distribution**:
   - Calculate the average median income of the dataset.
   - Check the distribution of the data using appropriate plots and explain the distribution.

2. **Housing Median Age Distribution**:
   - Draw an appropriate plot to see the distribution of housing median age and explain observations.

3. **Relationship between Median Income and Median House Values**:
   - Visualize how median income and median house values are related.

4. **Handle Missing Data by Deleting Examples**:
   - Create a dataset by deleting the corresponding examples for which total bedrooms are not available.

5. **Handle Missing Data by Filling with Mean Value**:
   - Create a dataset by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total bedrooms in the original dataset.

6. **User-defined Function for Calculating Median Value**:
   - Write a programming construct to calculate the median value of the dataset wherever required.

7. **Geographical Data Visualization**:
   - Plot latitude versus longitude and explain observations.

8. **Subset Data for 'Near Ocean' Proximity**:
   - Create a dataset for which the ocean proximity is ‘Near ocean’.

9. **Mean and Median of Median Income for 'Near Ocean' Proximity**:
   - Find the mean and median of the median income for the dataset created in question 8.

10. **New Column for Total Bedroom Size**:
    - Create a new column named total_bedroom_size with categories small, medium, and large based on the total bedrooms.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment.

## Deliverables

1. **Documented Report**: A detailed report in Word or PDF format explaining the analysis, findings, and insights.
2. **Python Scripts**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data analysis and visualization.
3. **Visualizations**: Plots and charts illustrating various aspects of the dataset.
